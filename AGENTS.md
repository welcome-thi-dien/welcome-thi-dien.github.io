# Project Instructions

## Overview
- This is a pure HTML/CSS/JS project for playing chess against the computer.
- The computer uses the Stockfish engine with selectable difficulty (easy to hard).
- The project is a gift for my girlfriend, so win/lose outcomes must show sweet, supportive messages.

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript only.
- Stockfish integration (engine + move generation).

## Core Features
- Play chess vs. the engine (not PvP).
- Difficulty selector with multiple levels (easy/medium/hard or similar).
- Win message: romantic encouragement.
- Loss message: comforting encouragement.

## Tone/Content Requirements
- Messages should be short, warm, and supportive.
- Use Vietnamese for user-facing copy.
- Avoid harsh or competitive language.

## UI Expectations
- Simple, clean layout; responsive on mobile and desktop.
- Difficulty selector is clearly visible.
- Win/Lose message area is prominent.

## Implementation Notes
- Keep code lightweight; no frameworks.
- Separate concerns: HTML structure, CSS styles, JS logic.
- If adding assets, keep them inside the project root.
